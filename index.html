              Each player is dealt 2 cards to start, computer/dealer has one face down until their turn. 
              Player will go first and hit (get another card) until they either stay or are over 2. 
              After that, it is the computers turn. 
              The winner is decided by getting blackjack (one jack and one ace) or whoever has the higher number at or under 21.

            Growing up, baseball was everything. I played almost every day from the age of 5 to 19. If you asked 
            the 10 year old me what I was going to be, of course I would have said a pitcher for the Yankees.
            My Senior year of high school, I was the captain of my team and was awarded First Team All Greater Rochester as a pitcher.
            Baseball really taught me a lot about life. 
            It taught me that hard work pays off, how to be a team player, and how to take over when the time is right.
            While some dreams fade, others come to life.

              Music has always been a huge part of my life. I am a fully self taught guitar player who started
               when I was 21. I picked up my first guitar in college and loved everything about it. 
               To say Guitar Hero wasn't a factor would be a lie &#128540;
               <br>
               Putting in a lot of practice,
               and getting direct results was something that fits my personality perfectly. 
               I was most surprised about the ability to change my mental state and be a release after playing.

              I have spent a fair share of time in the past 2 years on boats, banks, and docks fishing.
              Honing my skills and practicing patience, I have been able to catch some pretty cool fish and have 
              a blast doing it. There are a lot of life lessions to learn with a rod in your hand, and I am excited to
              keep learning them.

              Travel is an important part of my life.
              I have been lucky enough to travel to some increible places in my life with my Partner, Anna.
              Some of my favorite places so far have been:
              <br> <br>
              Malaysa - Had the coolest scenary, delicious street food, and kindest people.
              <br><br>
              Paris - Amazing architecture and some of the best food I have ever had. 
              <br><br>
              Lisbon - Breath taking views, beautiful mosiac tiles, and the best custard tarts in the world.
              <br><br>
              Sydney - As far from home as I have ever been, and it was worth it. Loved the city vibes and culture. Unfortunately did not get to see any Kangeroos
